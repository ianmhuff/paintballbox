The code that runs my custom-built paintball game management system

You can see more about the project [here](https://www.appropedia.org/User:Imhuff#Personal_Projects).

This project utilized the following adafruit products:
- [Adafruit Character LCD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/181)
- [Adafruit I2S Amp](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3006)
- [Speaker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1314)
- [3x4 Matrix Keypad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3845)
- [Adafruit Character LCD Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/292)
- [Adafruit Arcade Button](https://www.adafruit.com/product/471)

I also utilized the [pad4pi library](https://pypi.org/project/pad4pi/) for numeric keypad functionality.

My system runs on a Raspberry Pi Model B+, but it shouldn't have any trouble running on any other model/revision.
