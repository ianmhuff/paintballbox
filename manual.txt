--Introduction--
The Paintball Game Management System is a system which enables certain styles of play in sports such as paintball and airsoft that would be impossible without some form of computer control.
This includes modes like King of the Hill, in which the system acts as a sort of "capture point", and Couter-Strike-Mini, inspired by the Counter-Strike video game series, which has the system act as a "bomb" that one team must plant and the other must defuse.
The main advantage of utilizing such a system is its ability to manage various types of timers in a way that human players would not be able to accomplish with 100% accuracy otherwise.
This system also provides an intuitive interface that makes navigation of its functions easy for players.
This manual details some of the device's inner workings and can serve as a reference for players.


--Technical--
The "brains" of the device simply consists of a Raspberry Pi running a Python script which contains the logic for all of the game modes.
Each of the interface components is connected to the Pi's 40-pin GPIO.
The device is powered by a USB battery bank, which grants it several hours of battery life.
Sould access to the device's internals be necessary, there is a notch near the speaker which can be used to lift the wood panel.
Currently, there is no way to power the device on or off without lifing the panel, though this is one of the top priorities for future revisions.


--Interface--
The interface consists of the following components, mounted to a wood panel:
Display - this Character LCD display shows messages and menu options.
LEDs - these addressable RGB LEDs are used to give quick visual feedback to players.
Speaker - similarly, this speaker provides audio feedback to players, both in menus and in games.
Buttons - two arcade-style buttons color coded for red and blue teams.
Keypad - A numeric keypad with keys for 0-9, plus two special keys (* and #), used for input in menus and inputting codes in certain games.


--Control - Menus--
The system's menus are navigated using the numeric keypad.
On each menu, the available options will be cycled onto the display, along with a number.
To select one of the options, simply press the numeric key associated with that option.
Once a game mode is selected from the main menu, a set of "setup options" will need to be selected before the game begins.
These setup options usually relate to the duration and difficulty of the game mode, and allow for a great degree of customization.
Once all setup options have been selected, the system will initiate a ten-second countdown, accompanied by countdown sound effects, before starting the game.
In addition, on the main menu, the * and # keys can be used to decrease or increase the volume, respectively.


--Control - In-Game--
Once a game has begun, players can interact with the system via either the buttons or the keypad.
The specifics of player input is determined on a game-by-game basis.
Each game's objectives and input methods are detailed in the following sections.
In addition, the * key can be used to end any game that is currently in progress.


--Main Menu--
	On the main menu ("Choose game mode"), available options are as follows:
	- 1: King of the Hill
	- 2: Counter-Strike-Mini
	- 3: Counter-Strike-Code
	- 4: Defend-Mini
	- 5: Defend-Code
	Additionally, the * and # keys can be used to decrease or increase the volume, respectively.


--Game Mode 1: King of the Hill--
	In King of the Hill, there are two teams - red and blue.
	Each team has their own timer that counts down when that team is in control of the point.
	In order to take control of, or "capture", the point, that team's button must be pressed.
	The lights will change color to indicate which team is currently in control of the point.
	At the beginning of the game, no team controls the point, and the lights will turn green.
	The team whose timer reaches 0 first is the victor.
	
	Setup Options:
	- Timer Duration - the total time a team must control the point for in order to win
	

--Game Mode 2: Counter-Strike-Mini--
	In Counter-Strike-Mini, there are two teams, each with unique rules and objectives:
	- "Terrorists"
		- The system, or "bomb", should be carried to a designated area.
		- The red button can then be pressed in order to "arm" or "plant" the bomb.
			- Red lights and a sound effect will indicate success.
		- Upon planting the bomb, a fuse timer will be displayed.
		- Win Conditions:
			- All opponents are eliminated
			- The bomb is successfully planted and its fuse timer reaches 0
	- "Counter-Terrorists"
		- Prior to a successful plant, the CT team's goal is to prevent planting.
		- If the bomb is successfully planted, the goal is then to defuse it.
		- Defusal is done by pressing the blue button.
			- Blue lights and a sound effect will indicate success.
		- Win Conditions:
			- All opponents are eliminated
			- The bomb is prevented from being planted before the game timer reaches 0
			- The bomb is disarmed before its fuse timer reaches 0
	The game has a timer which ends the round if the bomb is never planted.
	At any point in time, the * or # keys can be used to manually end the game.
	This mode is best played as a series of many short rounds, swapping roles periodically.
	
	Setup Options:
	- Timer Duration - the time until the round ends, unless the bomb is planted
	- Fuse Duration - controls how much time will pass before the bomb explodes, once planted
			

--Game Mode 3: Counter-Strike-Code--
	The gameplay of this mode is nearly identical to that of #2, with one key difference.
	Rather than simply pressing the blue button to defuse, the CT team must instead input a code.
	The code is shown one digit at a time on the display.
	When a digit is entered successfully:
		- A green light will activate
		- The next digit will be displayed after a brief delay
	This mode can make the CT team's objective more difficult when compared with mode #2.
	Furthermore, the length of the code can be adjusted for additional balancing.
	
	Setup Options:
	- Timer Duration - the time until the round ends, unless the bomb is planted
	- Fuse Duration - the time that passes before the bomb explodes, once it is planted
	- Code Length - the number of digits in the code
	

--Game Mode 4: Defend-Mini--
	Defend-Mini is a simple "game mode" that allows point-defense-style games to be managed.
	The game lasts for a set amount of time, but either button can be pressed to end it early.
	If the game ends by a button being pressed, the "attacking" team wins.
	If the game ends by the timer reaching 0, the "defending" team wins.

	Setup Options:
	- Timer Duration - the amount of time the defending team must defend the point


--Game Mode 5: Defend-Code--
	The gameplay of this mode is nearly identical to that of #4, with one key difference.
	Rather than simply pressing either button, the defending team must instead input a code.
	The code is shown one digit at a time on the display.
	This mode makes the attacking team's objective more difficult when compared to mode #4.
	Furthermore, the length of the code can be adjusted for additional balancing.
	
	Setup Options:
	- Timer Duration - the amount of time the defending team must defend the point
	- Code Length - the number of digits in the code
